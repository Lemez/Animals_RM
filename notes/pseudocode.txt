	placeholder_images  -> cells (show)


3) Table Controller (LANDSCAPE)

	beforeloading:

		@tries = 0
		cell 1 image = image
		cell 1 letter = letter (hidden)

		low array = cell 1 letter hash

	didload:
		display: 	cell 1 image,
					low array (cell 1) 

		animation: 	cell 1 image,
					low array (cell 1) 

		low_array.item.ontap:

			@tries += 1

			if low_array.item.text == cell1.letter 
				do correct stuff

			if low_array.item.text != cell1.letter 
				do incorrect stuff


		correct_stuff:

			play sound (letter)
			show and animate cell 1 letter
			stop cell 1 image animation
			replace cell 2 placeholder with image
			show and animate cell 2 letter  
			low array = cell 2 letter hash

		incorrect_stuff:

						# (3/5) * 100 
						# 'toast' => 60

					email_parent_with_score if he/she wants it

				if AutoPlay:
					go to Picture Controller after 5 seconds
